  <h2>Features</h2>

  <p>
    This plugin allows a content editor to turn on and off any post editor ("Gutenberg") block.
    An editor can only disable a block that is not currently in use. Blocks that exist on at least
    one post or page are not eligible to be turned off.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, this plugin generates a list of all blocks in use by the site. A content editor
    can see how many times and on what posts or pages any particular block is used.
