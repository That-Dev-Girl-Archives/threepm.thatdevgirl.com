  <h2>Features</h2>

  <p>
    This WordPress plugin extends the WooCommerce plugin. As a store
    administrator, you can add an incremental flat rate shipping fee to a
    user's cart based on the number of items in the cart.
  </p>

  <h3><span class="fa fa-gears"></span> Customizable</h3>

  <p>
    Apply an additional shipping fee after any number of items in a user's cart.
    The fee can be flat or it can increment by multiples of a specified number
    of items.
  </p>

  <h3><span class="fa fa-rocket"></span> Lightweight</h3>

  <p>
    The WC Tiered Shipping plugin is short and sweet, weighing in at under 6.5k
    for the entire plugin.
  </p>

  <h3><span class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></span> Compatible</h3>

  <p>
    This plugin integrates with the WooCommerce settings panel and is compatible
    with the latest versions of WordPress &amp; WooCommerce.
  </p>

  <h2>Details</h2>

  <p>
    WordPress administrative users can create a tiered flat rate shipping fee
    based on the total number of items in a WooCommerce cart. The store
    administrator can choose to apply this shipping method to all available
    countries that the store may ship to, or only specific countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two tiers in this shipping method:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Base shipping fee:</strong> This is the base (default) flat
      shipping fee that is applied automatically to the cart total for any
      number of items.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Additional shipping fee for tiers:</strong> This is the additional
      shipping fee that is added to the base fee if the number of items in the
      user's cart exceeds a specified number.  This tiered fee can either be a
      flat fee, meaning that it is applied to carts of any size above the
      specified tier quantity, or a progressive fee, meaning that the tier
      quantity is used as a multiplier to the tiered fee.
    </li>
  </ul>
